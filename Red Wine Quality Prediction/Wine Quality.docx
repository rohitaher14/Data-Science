OBJECTIVE • Our main objective is to predict the wine quality using machine learning through Python programming language • A large dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to analyse the quality of wine through different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity etc. • All these parameters will be analysed through Machine Learning algorithms like random forest classifier algorithm which will helps to rate the wine on scale 1 - 10 or bad - good. • Output obtained would further be checked for correctness and model will be optimized accordingly. • It can support the wine expert evaluations and ultimately improve the production.
